# Reliably CLI
Reliability toolbox for developers from the command line.

### Usage

To check your Kubernetes manifests for Reliably Advice and Suggestions, simply run:

```
$ reliably discover
```

It will scan for manifests recursively in your current working directory.

To indicate a specific folder, you can use the `--dir` flag, as follow:

```
$ reliably discover --dir ./manifests
```

The CLI supports multiple output formats, such as `simple` *(default)*,
`json`, `yaml`, `sarif`, `codeclimate`. To report in a specific format,
you can use the `--format` or `-f` flag, as follow:

```
$ reliably discover --format sarif
```

The CLI prints out the report to the standard output, by default, but it can
write the report to a local file. You can indicate the path of the report
with the `--output` or `-o` flag, as follow:

```
$ reliably discover --output ./report.txt
```
